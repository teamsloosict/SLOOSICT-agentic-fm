# Library

This folder is your personal code library — a collection of reusable FileMaker objects stored as XML snippets. When AI composes scripts or calculation code, it can consult this library to incorporate proven patterns rather than writing everything from scratch.

The library ships empty. You populate it with code from your own solutions.

---

## How it works

Each file in this folder is an `fmxmlsnippet` — the same XML format FileMaker places on the clipboard when you copy objects. AI reads these files on demand, guided by `MANIFEST.md`, which acts as a keyword-indexed catalog of everything in the library.

**The workflow:**

1. You export objects from FileMaker as XML snippets and save them here.
2. You update `MANIFEST.md` to register the new files (AI can do this for you — see below).
3. When composing code, AI reads `MANIFEST.md`, finds keyword matches for the task at hand, and reads only the relevant files.

## Folder structure

Organize files into subfolders by FileMaker object type. The following folder names are the canonical categories used throughout FileMaker development:

| Folder | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| `Fields/` | Field definitions — data types, auto-enter options, validation rules |
| `Functions/` | Custom function definitions |
| `Layouts/` | Layout objects — buttons, portals, web viewers, and other UI components |
| `Menus/` | Custom menu sets |
| `Scripts/` | Complete scripts |
| `Steps/` | Reusable step blocks and script patterns (partial scripts) |
| `Tables/` | Table definitions |
| `Themes/` | Layout themes |
| `Webviews/` | Self-contained HTML for use in Set Web Viewer steps |

You may add subfolders within any category to organize further (for example, `Functions/JSON/` or `Functions/Text/`). Subfolder paths are reflected in `MANIFEST.md`.

## File format

Every file must be a valid `fmxmlsnippet`. The root element is always:

```xml
<fmxmlsnippet type="FMObjectList">
  <!-- one or more FileMaker objects -->
</fmxmlsnippet>
```

FileMaker writes this format to the clipboard when you copy objects. Each object type uses a different proprietary clipboard class — FileMaker objects are **not** plain text on the clipboard.

| What you copy in FileMaker | Clipboard class |
|----------------------------|-----------------|
| One or more script steps | `XMSS` |
| An entire script (from the Script Workspace list) | `XMSC` |
| One or more fields (from the Fields & Tables dialog) | `XMFD` |
| A custom function (from the Custom Functions dialog) | `XMFN` |
| Layout objects (selected on a layout) | `XML2` |
| A table definition (`<BaseTable>`) | `XMTB` |
| A value list | `XMVL` |
| A theme | `XMTH` |

### Getting a snippet out of FileMaker

Because FileMaker clipboard data is binary-encoded, **do not use `pbpaste`** — it will corrupt multi-byte UTF-8 characters such as `≠`, `≤`, `≥`, and `¶` that are common in FileMaker calculations.

Use the provided helper script instead:

```bash
# 1. Copy objects in FileMaker (⌘C)
# 2. Run:
source .venv/bin/activate
python agent/scripts/clipboard.py read agent/library/Scripts/script\ -\ My\ Utility.xml
```

The script auto-detects the clipboard class, extracts the binary data, decodes it to UTF-8, and writes formatted XML to the file you specify.

For full technical details on how the clipboard encoding works, see `agent/docs/CLIPBOARD.md`.

### Naming convention

Use descriptive, lowercase-with-hyphens file names that identify the object type and purpose:

```
script - HTTP Request.xml
steps - tryCatchTransaction.xml
function - JSONIsValid.xml
fields - default.xml
```

## Maintaining MANIFEST.md

`MANIFEST.md` is the index AI uses to find library items without reading every file. It maps each file to a plain-English description and a set of keyword tags.

**It ships empty.** You must populate it as you add files to the library.

### Asking AI to update the manifest

After adding or removing files, ask AI:

> "Scan the `agent/library` folder, compare it against `agent/library/MANIFEST.md`, and update the manifest — adding entries for any new files and removing entries for any deleted files. For new files, read each one to write an accurate description and relevant keyword tags."

AI will list the folder, diff it against the current manifest, read any new files, and rewrite `MANIFEST.md` in place.

### Updating the manifest manually

Open `MANIFEST.md` and add a row to the appropriate section table:

```
| `Category/filename` | One-sentence description of what the code does | keyword1, keyword2, keyword3 |
```

**Tips for writing good keywords:**

- Use the words a developer would say when asking for the code, not the filename.
- Include common synonyms and related concepts.
- For functions, include the function name itself as a keyword.
- For step patterns, include the names of the key script steps involved.

## Using an existing snippet collection

If you maintain snippets in a separate repository, you can link it here as a git submodule:

```bash
git submodule add <repo-url> agent/library
```

After linking, run the AI manifest update described above so the new files are indexed.
