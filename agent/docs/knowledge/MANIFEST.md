# Knowledge Base Manifest

Curated behavioral intelligence about FileMaker Pro. These documents capture nuances, gotchas, and practical insights that inform better script composition decisions. They complement — but are distinct from — the vendor reference docs in `agent/docs/filemaker/` and `agent/docs/mbs/` and others.

All paths are relative to `agent/docs/knowledge/`.

## Conventions for knowledge files

### Referencing FileMaker steps and functions

Knowledge files frequently mention script steps and calculation functions. Each knowledge file should include a **References** section at the bottom that lists every step and function mentioned in the document with lookup paths.

The local docs in `agent/docs/filemaker/` are generated by `agent/docs/filemaker/fetch_docs.py` and may not be present. Each reference entry should provide both the local path and the Claris help URL so AI can fall back gracefully.

Format for the References section:

```
## References

| Name | Type | Local doc | Claris help |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Perform Find | step | `agent/docs/filemaker/script-steps/perform-find.md` | [perform-find](https://help.claris.com/en/pro-help/content/perform-find.html) |
| GetSummary | function | `agent/docs/filemaker/functions/logical/getsummary.md` | [getsummary](https://help.claris.com/en/pro-help/content/getsummary.html) |
```

Slug rules:
- Lowercase, hyphen-separated for steps: `Replace Field Contents` -> `replace-field-contents`
- Lowercase, no separators for functions: `GetNthRecord` -> `getnthrecord`
- Local step paths: `agent/docs/filemaker/script-steps/<slug>.md`
- Local function paths: `agent/docs/filemaker/functions/<category>/<slug>.md`
- Claris URL: `https://help.claris.com/en/pro-help/content/<slug>.html`

### File naming

Use lowercase-kebab-case filenames (e.g., `found-sets.md`, `record-locking.md`) to stay consistent with the naming in `agent/docs/filemaker/script-steps/`.

### Session terminology

A "session" in FileMaker refers to the period from when a user opens a hosted file until they close it. Global fields and global variables (`$$`) are session-scoped — their values do not persist once the session ends. The initial value of a global field in a hosted file is whatever was stored before the file was hosted.
