name: script-refactor
description: Analyse an existing FileMaker script and produce an improved version — better error handling, cleaner variable naming, consolidation of repeated logic — while preserving observable behaviour. At Tier 1 the refactored script is placed on the clipboard for manual paste. At Tier 3 the agent can autonomously deploy the replacement into Script Workspace. Triggers on phrases like "refactor", "improve this script", "clean up script", "modernise script", or "optimize script".

# Script Refactor

Analyse an existing script, identify improvements, and produce a refactored version as fmxmlsnippet — preserving observable behaviour while improving structure, error handling, and conventions.

---

## Step 1: Determine the automation tier

Read `agent/config/automation.json` and check `project_tier` (preferred) or `default_tier`:

- **Tier 1** — refactored script goes to clipboard with paste instructions
- **Tier 3** — agent can deploy the refactored script directly into Script Workspace, replacing the original

---

## Step 2: Locate the target script

If the developer has not already identified the script, use the `script-lookup` skill to find it.

Once identified, read the human-readable version from `agent/xml_parsed/scripts_sanitized/` to understand the current logic. Also check if an fmxmlsnippet version already exists in `agent/sandbox/`.

If neither exists, convert the SaXML version to fmxmlsnippet:

```bash
python3 agent/scripts/fm_xml_to_snippet.py "agent/xml_parsed/scripts/{solution}/{path}.xml" "agent/sandbox/{ScriptName}.xml"
```

Read `agent/CONTEXT.json` or index files for any field/layout/script references needed.

---

## Step 3: Resolve the call tree

Before analysing logic, build the full picture of every script involved.

1. **Extract Perform Script references** — scan the human-readable script for all `Perform Script` lines. Extract every target script name.
2. **Load each subscript** — locate and read each subscript's human-readable version from `scripts_sanitized/`. Use the scripts index to resolve names to paths: `grep "ScriptName" "agent/context/{solution}/scripts.index"`
3. **Recurse** — each subscript may call further subscripts. Repeat until no new references are found. Track visited scripts to avoid cycles.
4. **Present the call tree** — show the developer the full scope before starting analysis:

```
Call tree: [Script Name]
├── Subscript A
│   └── Subscript A1
├── Subscript B
└── Subscript C
```

Flag any `Perform Script by name` (calculated names) that cannot be statically resolved — ask the developer to clarify.

---

## Step 4: Analyse the script

Read through the target script and its call tree. Identify issues in these categories:

### Error handling
- Missing `Set Error Capture [ On ]` / `Allow User Abort [ Off ]` header
- Steps that can fail without an immediate `Get ( LastError )` check
- Error data captured in separate steps instead of the single-expression `$errData` pattern (see `agent/docs/knowledge/error-data-capture.md`)
- Missing cleanup path (no revert/commit on failure)

### Structure
- Deeply nested If/Else chains that should be a single-pass loop
- Repeated logic that could be hoisted to a variable or extracted to a subscript
- Missing guard clauses (parameter validation, empty found set checks)
- Dead code (disabled steps that serve no documentation purpose)

### Naming and conventions
- Variable names that don't follow conventions (`agent/docs/CODING_CONVENTIONS.md`)
- Inconsistent naming within the script
- Magic numbers or repeated string literals that should be variables

### Performance
- Unnecessary layout switches
- Commit Records inside loops (should be after the loop where possible)
- Redundant Perform Find when a constrained find or GTRR would suffice

### Cross-script issues
Review the interactions between the target script and its subscripts:
- **Parameter contract** — does the caller pass what the callee expects?
- **Result handling** — does the caller check `Get ( ScriptResult )`?
- **Layout context** — does a subscript change the layout without restoring it?
- **Error propagation** — does a subscript report errors via `Exit Script` result?

Flag issues in subscripts but **do not refactor them** — only the target script is modified unless the developer asks otherwise.

---

## Step 5: Plan the refactoring

Use the `implementation-plan` skill internally to reason about the approach. When called internally, produce the plan inline without waiting for developer confirmation.

Present a summary of proposed changes to the developer:

```
## Proposed refactoring: [Script Name]

### Changes
1. Add error handling header (Set Error Capture + Allow User Abort)
2. Wrap main logic in single-pass loop with error exits
3. Replace inline find with Go to Related Record
4. Hoist repeated client name lookup to $clientName variable
5. Fix error capture pattern (separate steps → single expression)

### Preserved behaviour
- Same parameter format and exit result
- Same layout navigation sequence
- Same field modifications

### Risk
- None — structural changes only, no logic changes
```

Wait for developer confirmation before generating code.

---

## Step 6: Generate the refactored script

Work from the fmxmlsnippet base in `agent/sandbox/`. Apply only the targeted changes — unchanged steps remain verbatim.

Follow all output rules from CLAUDE.md:
- Steps only within `<fmxmlsnippet type="FMObjectList">` — no `<Script>` wrapper
- Use step catalog for step structure, not xml_parsed verbose format
- Validate all field/layout/script references against CONTEXT.json or index files

Run the validator:

```bash
python3 agent/scripts/validate_snippet.py agent/sandbox/{ScriptName}.xml
```

Fix any errors before proceeding.

---

## Step 7: Present the diff

Show the developer what changed. Present a before/after comparison of the human-readable script — not the raw XML.

### Webviewer output (if available)

Check if the webviewer is reachable:

```bash
curl -s --max-time 2 -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" {webviewer_url}
```

If available, push a diff payload to the webviewer for side-by-side Monaco rendering:

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "diff", "before": "<original HR script>", "content": "<refactored HR script>"}' \
  {companion_url}/webviewer/push
```

### Terminal output (always)

Regardless of webviewer availability, present a concise summary in the terminal listing each change with the relevant line numbers (from the human-readable version).

---

## Step 8: Deploy

### Tier 3 (autonomous)

After developer approval:

1. Load clipboard via `POST {companion_url}/clipboard`
2. Deploy via `deploy.py` or direct companion calls:
   - For an existing script: use Tier 2 mechanics (open script tab via Agentic-fm Paste, AXPress tab, Cmd+A → Delete → Cmd+V) to replace the content
   - Alternatively: `POST {companion_url}/trigger` with raw AppleScript to open the script tab and paste
3. Confirm deployment succeeded

### Tier 1 (developer-assisted)

Present paste instructions:

> The refactored script is on your clipboard. To install it:
>
> 1. Open **Script Name** in Script Workspace
> 2. **Cmd+A** — select all existing steps and delete
> 3. **Cmd+V** — paste

---

## Constraints

- **Preserve observable behaviour** — the refactored script must produce the same results for the same inputs. If a change would alter behaviour, flag it explicitly and get developer approval.
- **Do not refactor subscripts** unless explicitly asked. Flag issues in subscripts in the analysis but only modify the target script.
- **Do not add features** — refactoring improves structure, not functionality. If the developer's request includes new functionality, that is a script creation task, not a refactor.
