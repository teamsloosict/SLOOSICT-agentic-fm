## Dependencies

### FileMaker Pro 21.0+

The minimum version is **21.0**. Earlier versions lack:

- `GetTableDDL` — used by `Context.fmfn` to discover foreign key relationships
- `While` — used by `Context.fmfn` for iteration
- `Create Data File` / `Open Data File` / `Write to Data File` / `Close Data File` — used by the **Push Context** script to write `CONTEXT.json` to disk

### Companion Server

The **Explode XML** companion script calls `agent/scripts/companion_server.py` — a lightweight HTTP server — to run shell commands from FileMaker without any third-party plugin. FileMaker communicates with it via `Insert from URL`.

**Start the server before running Explode XML:**

```bash
python agent/scripts/companion_server.py
```

The server listens on port 8765 by default and uses only Python stdlib — no virtualenv is required. Keep it running in a terminal while you work.

The other two companion scripts (**Get agentic-fm path** and **Push Context**) use only native FileMaker steps and do not require the companion server.

### MBS FileMaker Plugin _(legacy — no longer required)_

Earlier versions of agentic-fm used the MBS FileMaker Plugin for shell execution in the **Explode XML** script. This dependency has been removed. If you have an existing installation that still uses MBS, it will continue to work, but new setups should use `companion_server.py` instead.

The MBS functions previously used were:

- `Shell.New` / `Shell.Execute` / `Shell.Wait` / `Shell.Release`
- `Shell.AddEnvironment` / `Shell.SetArgumentsList`
- `Shell.ReadOutputText` / `Shell.ReadErrorText`
- `Path.FileMakerPathToNativePath`
- `IsError`

### fm-xml-export-exploder

A Rust binary that parses FileMaker XML exports into individual files. Used by both the **Explode XML** companion script and by `fmparse.sh` when called from the terminal.

**Installation:**

1. Download the macOS binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/bc-m/fm-xml-export-exploder/releases/latest)
2. On first run, macOS Gatekeeper will block it. Right-click the binary and choose **Open** once to clear the restriction.
3. Create `~/bin/` if it does not exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/bin
   ```
4. Move the binary there and make it executable:
   ```bash
   mv fm-xml-export-exploder ~/bin/
   chmod +x ~/bin/fm-xml-export-exploder
   ```

> **Why `~/bin`?** The **Explode XML** companion script passes `~/bin/fm-xml-export-exploder` as the `FM_XML_EXPLODER_BIN` environment variable to `fmparse.sh`. If you want to place the binary elsewhere, open the **Explode XML** script in FileMaker and update the `Set Variable [$payload ; JSONSetElement ( "{}" ;[ "exploder_bin_path" ;  ...]` step to reflect your actual path.

When calling `fmparse.sh` directly from the terminal you can also override the path via the environment variable:

```bash
FM_XML_EXPLODER_BIN=/your/path/fm-xml-export-exploder ./fmparse.sh -s "My Solution" /path/to/export.xml
```

### Python 3

Required for `agent/scripts/clipboard.py` (loading snippets onto the FileMaker clipboard), `agent/scripts/validate_snippet.py` (post-generation validation), and `agent/scripts/companion_server.py` (shell execution server). All three use Python stdlib only — no virtualenv is required.

Python 3 ships with macOS or can be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew install python
```

Run scripts directly — no activation step needed:

```bash
python agent/scripts/clipboard.py write filemaker/agentic-fm.xml
python agent/scripts/companion_server.py
```

### xmllint

Required by `fmcontext.sh` to extract data from the exploded XML. Ships with macOS as part of libxml2. On Linux:

```bash
apt-get install libxml2-utils
```

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install the Context custom function

1. Open your FileMaker solution in FileMaker Pro.
2. Go to **File > Manage > Custom Functions**.
3. Click **New** and create a function named `Context` with one parameter: `task` (type: Text).
4. Copy the entire contents of `filemaker/Context.fmfn` and paste it into the calculation editor.
5. Click **OK** and save.

### 2. Install the companion scripts

Load `filemaker/agentic-fm.xml` onto the FileMaker clipboard using `clipboard.py`, then paste into the Script Workspace:

```bash
python agent/scripts/clipboard.py write filemaker/agentic-fm.xml
```

Switch to FileMaker, open the **Script Workspace** (**Scripts > Script Workspace**), click in the script list, and press **⌘V**. A folder named **agentic-fm** containing the three scripts will appear.

### 3. Configure the repo path

Run the **Get agentic-fm path** script once (from the Scripts menu or Script Workspace). A folder picker will appear. Select the root of the agentic-fm repo folder. The path is stored in `$$AGENTIC.FM` and persists for the session.

> This script must be run again each time FileMaker is relaunched, as global variables do not persist across sessions. Consider adding a call to it in your solution's startup script.

### 3.5. Start the companion server

Before running **Explode XML**, start `companion_server.py` in a terminal and leave it running:

```bash
python agent/scripts/companion_server.py
```

This server listens on port 8765 and handles the shell command that **Explode XML** issues via `Insert from URL`. You will need to restart it each time you open a new terminal session.

### 4. Run Explode XML

Run the **Explode XML** script to perform the first Save as XML export and populate `agent/xml_parsed/`. Re-run it any time the solution schema or scripts change.

> The script derives the `fmparse.sh` path from the `$$AGENTIC.FM` global variable set by **Get agentic-fm path**, so the repo can be located anywhere on disk.

### 5. Push Context before each AI session

Navigate to the layout you are working on and run the **Push Context** script. A dialog will prompt you for a task description. After you click OK, the context is written to `agent/CONTEXT.json` and you are ready to work with AI.

## Optional: agentic-fm web viewer

The agentic-fm web viewer is a browser-based Monaco editor embedded directly in FileMaker. It provides a three-panel interface — script editor, XML preview, and AI chat — without leaving FileMaker Pro.

### Adding the web viewer to a layout

Add a **WebViewer** object to any layout and set its URL to `http://localhost:8080` (the Vite dev server). Name the object exactly **`agentic-fm`** — this name is required for the bridge script and custom menu integration to work correctly.

The web viewer works on any layout, but a **dedicated layout** is strongly recommended:

- Place only the web viewer object on the layout with no other interactive objects
- Make the layout window **resizable** so you can expand the editor to a comfortable size
- A single-object layout ensures the custom menu set (assigned per-layout) applies consistently whenever the editor is in use

See `webviewer/WEBVIEWER_INTEGRATION.md` for full setup and development workflow details.

### Custom menu integration (optional)

The `filemaker/custom_menu/` folder contains an optional custom menu set that adds five editor-aware menus to the layout hosting the web viewer. These menus expose keyboard shortcuts for common Monaco editor actions (comment toggle, indent, move line, find, and more) without requiring the developer to remember key bindings.

See `filemaker/custom_menu/README.md` for the integration steps.
