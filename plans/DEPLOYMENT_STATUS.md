# Deployment Module — Build Status

Session-persistent notes on what was built, every quirk discovered, and where to resume. Read this at the start of any session continuing deployment work.

---

## What was built

### `agent/scripts/deploy.py`
CLI + importable module. Reads `agent/config/automation.json`. Three tiers:
- **Tier 1** (universal, no dependencies): POSTs XML to companion `/clipboard`, returns paste instructions
- **Tier 2** (MBS + AppleScript, two-phase): Phase 1: `do script "Agentic-fm Paste"` opens script tab via `MBS("ScriptWorkspace.OpenScript")` — the only MBS function used; Phase 2: companion fires `raw_applescript` for AXPress tab focus + paste via System Events keystrokes from outside FM
- **Tier 3** (AppleScript only, no MBS): Monolithic `raw_applescript` via companion — custom menu guard → Window menu file switch → Script Workspace → Cmd+N → rename → Cmd+V → Cmd+S. No FM-side script involved.

CLI usage:
```bash
python3 agent/scripts/deploy.py <xml_path> [target_script] [--tier N] [--auto-save] [--no-auto-save] [--replace | --append] [--file <fm_file_name>]
```

**Tier 2 destructive-paste protection**: When deploying to an existing script via Tier 2 without `--replace` or `--append`, the CLI prompts:
```
Script 'My Script' will be modified.
  [r] Replace — select all existing steps and paste (destructive)
  [a] Append  — paste after existing steps
  [c] Cancel
Choice [r/a/c]:
```
- `--replace`: skips prompt, always replaces (select all + delete + paste)
- `--append`: skips prompt, always appends (paste only, no select all)
- No flag: interactive prompt required before proceeding

**Multi-file targeting**: `--file <name>` targets a specific FM document. When omitted, `_resolve_target_file()` auto-resolves from:
1. `CONTEXT.json` → `solution` field
2. `automation.json` → `solutions` keys (only if exactly 1 solution)

### `agent/config/automation.json`
Key fields: `default_tier`, `project_tier`, `auto_save`, `fm_app_name`, `companion_url`.
- `default_tier: 1` — safe default for new developers
- `project_tier: 3` — target for this project (once Tier 3 proven)
- `auto_save: false` — override per deploy with `--auto-save`
- `fm_app_name` must match the exact AppleScript application name including em dash and version: `"FileMaker Pro — 22.0.4.406"`

### `Agentic-fm Paste` FM script
FM script using one MBS function: `ScriptWorkspace.OpenScript`. Called by companion `/trigger` via AppleScript `do script`. **Only opens the script tab** — paste is handled externally by deploy.py. Flow:
1. `GET localhost:8765/pending` → retrieves `target` (script name)
2. `Perform AppleScript: tell me to activate`
3. `Open Script Workspace` step (native FM)
4. `MBS("ScriptWorkspace.OpenScript"; $target)` — the only MBS call
5. Exit Script with JSON result

The actual paste sequence (AXPress tab + Cmd+A → Delete → Cmd+V) runs from outside FM via deploy.py's Phase 2 `raw_applescript`. AXPress must run from outside FM — Perform AppleScript within FM causes Script Workspace to lose step editor focus.

Note: `agent/sandbox/Agentic-fm Paste.xml` is the installable fmxmlsnippet version. The canonical reference is now in `xml_parsed/scripts_sanitized/` after the latest Explode XML export.

### Companion server additions (`agent/scripts/companion_server.py`)
Endpoints:
- `GET /pending` — returns and clears `{target, auto_save, select_all}` job set by last `/trigger` call
- `POST /pending` — sets the pending job directly (for testing); accepts `target`, `auto_save`, `select_all`
- `POST /clipboard` — writes XML to macOS clipboard via `clipboard.py`
- `POST /trigger` — fires `osascript` to `do script` in FM Pro or executes `raw_applescript`; accepts optional `target_file` for multi-file document targeting; sets pending job before firing

### `agent/scripts/test_deploy.py`
Interactive deployment test suite. 9 tests across 3 phases:
- **Phase 1** (Foreground): T1, T2-R, T2-A, T2-AS, T3
- **Phase 2** (Backgrounded): T2-R-BG, T3-BG
- **Phase 3** (Multi-file): T2-MF, T3-MF

```bash
python3 agent/scripts/test_deploy.py --phase 1   # foreground, single file
python3 agent/scripts/test_deploy.py --phase 2   # FM backgrounded
python3 agent/scripts/test_deploy.py --phase 3   # multi-file targeting
python3 agent/scripts/test_deploy.py --test T2-R  # single test
python3 agent/scripts/test_deploy.py --cleanup    # remove test fixtures
```

Results logged to `agent/debug/test-deploy-results.json`.

## Critical quirks discovered (do not re-learn these)

### System Events process name differs from AppleScript application name
`tell application "FileMaker Pro — 22.0.4.406"` uses the versioned name with em dash. But `tell process "..."` inside `tell application "System Events"` requires the base process name: `"FileMaker Pro"` — no version, no em dash. Using the versioned name in `tell process` causes a `-1728` error (object not found). Derive the process name by splitting `fm_app_name` on ` — ` and taking the first part.

### Script Workspace menu item errors when already open
`click menu item "Script Workspace..." of menu "Scripts" of menu bar 1` errors if the workspace is already open. Wrap in `try / end try` — if it errors the workspace is already open and you can proceed. If it succeeds, add `delay 1.0` before the next action.

### AppleScript parameter passing is broken in FM Pro 22
`do script "ScriptName" given parameter:"value"` compiles without error but `Get(ScriptParameter)` returns empty inside the triggered script. `with parameter "string"` gives a syntax error. **Workaround**: companion server stores the target in `/pending` before firing `do script`. FM script GETs `/pending` via Insert from URL.

### `menu bar` and `menu bar 1` both fail in Perform AppleScript
`tell me to do menu item "Save All Scripts" of menu "Scripts" of menu bar` → "variable bar not found"
`tell me to do menu item "Save All Scripts" of menu "Scripts" of menu bar 1` → "A number can't go after this identifier"
FileMaker's built-in AppleScript parser rejects both. **Use System Events keystroke instead**:
`tell application "System Events" to keystroke "s" using {command down}`
Requires FM Pro to have Accessibility access in System Preferences → Privacy & Security → Accessibility.

### `MBS("ScriptWorkspace.SaveScript")` does not exist
Not a real MBS function. Use the System Events keystroke approach above.

### Agentic-fm Paste cannot deploy itself via Tier 2
`do script "Agentic-fm Paste"` triggers the script, which then opens itself in Script Workspace and attempts to replace its own steps while it is currently executing. FileMaker reverts or blocks changes to a running script's steps. **Always use Tier 1 (manual paste) to update Agentic-fm Paste itself.** This is not a real-world limitation — in normal use Agentic-fm Paste deploys other scripts.

### Script Workspace paste does NOT replace a selection — must delete first
Cmd+A selects all script steps, but Cmd+V does **not** overwrite the selection. The new steps are appended instead. The correct replace sequence is:
1. `Cmd+A` — select all steps
2. `Delete` (key code 51) — delete selected steps
3. `Cmd+V` — paste new steps

This is unlike standard text editors. Skipping the Delete step results in silent append regardless of what is selected.

### `Open Script Workspace` FM step requires FM to be frontmost
When FM is backgrounded, `Open Script Workspace` runs but the workspace either doesn't open or opens behind other windows, making subsequent operations unreliable. Fix: `tell me to activate` with `delay 1.0` must run **before** `Open Script Workspace`, giving macOS time to fully bring FM to front.

### `window 1` and `front window` are unreliable in System Events for Script Workspace
`tell window 1` errors with "Invalid index" when FM is backgrounded and the Script Workspace is not the first window in the accessibility tree. `front window` has the same underlying issue. **Use `windows whose title contains "Script Workspace"` to find the window by name.**

### Script Workspace focus: sidebar vs step editor
The Script Workspace split group contains two distinct focus zones:
1. **Script list sidebar** (left) — `Cmd+A` here selects all scripts; `Delete` shows "delete all N scripts?" dialog
2. **Step editor** (right) — `Cmd+A` here selects all steps; `Delete` removes them

After `MBS("ScriptWorkspace.OpenScript")`, focus remains in the sidebar. The script tab opens but is not active. **Solution**: `perform action "AXPress"` on the tab button (matched by `description`, not `name`) from outside FM. This must run via companion `osascript` — Perform AppleScript within FM loses the focus.

### Script Workspace tab buttons: match by description, not name
Tab buttons in Script Workspace's splitter group have `name = missing value` but `description = "ScriptName"`. Use `every button whose description is "X"` + `perform action "AXPress"` to activate a tab and focus the step editor. `click button "X"` fails because it matches by name.

### Perform AppleScript within FM loses Script Workspace step editor focus
`Perform AppleScript` steps that use System Events to interact with Script Workspace cause focus to shift from the step editor back to the script list sidebar. This happens consistently regardless of timing delays. **AXPress on the tab button only works from outside FM** (companion `osascript`, Script Editor). This is why Tier 2 uses a two-phase approach: Phase 1 (`do script`) opens the script tab, Phase 2 (`raw_applescript` via companion) does AXPress + paste.

### FM gates do-script privilege checks on the frontmost document
`do script` via AppleScript checks `fmextscriptaccess` on the **frontmost** document, not the targeted document. If the wrong file is frontmost and lacks `fmextscriptaccess`, `do script` fails with `-10004` even when `tell (first document whose name contains "X")` targets a file that has the privilege. **Fix**: switch the target file's window to front via the Window menu before calling `do script`.

### Custom menus can hide the Scripts menu
FileMaker files with custom menu sets may not have the standard Scripts menu. The Tools menu (always present with developer tools) has Custom Menus > [Standard FileMaker Menus]. Switch to standard menus before any Scripts menu operations. After switching files via the Window menu, switch again — each file may have its own custom menu set.

### New scripts have no steps — skip select/delete before paste
Tier 3 creates a new script and pastes into it. `Cmd+A → Delete` in an empty script beeps (nothing to select/delete). Just `Cmd+V` directly — paste appends to the empty script.

### Cmd+S after rename is unnecessary and beeps
After `Cmd+N` + rename + Return in Script Workspace, the script name is accepted without needing `Cmd+S`. An extra save at this point beeps because there are no unsaved changes.

### Cmd+S shortcut opens Script Workspace but hits layout window when backgrounded
`keystroke "s" using {command down, shift down}` was attempted as an alternative to the `Open Script Workspace` FM step. When FM layouts are frontmost, the keystroke is misinterpreted — FM shows the "Before typing, press Tab or click in a field" dialog. Do not use this approach; rely on the `Open Script Workspace` FM step with `tell me to activate` + `delay 1.0` before it.

### System beep after deploy = paste likely failed
`Cmd+S` (auto_save) beeps when the script has no unsaved changes. If a developer hears a system beep immediately after a Tier 2 deploy with `auto_save` on, it almost certainly means the paste step didn't land — the script opened correctly but no steps were written, so FileMaker had nothing to save. Check that FM Pro was frontmost and the Script Workspace had focus.

### Use `tell me to activate` inside `Perform AppleScript`, not `tell application "FileMaker Pro" to activate`
When FileMaker executes a `Perform AppleScript` step, the script context is already inside FileMaker. `tell me` refers directly to the running FM application object. Using `tell application "FileMaker Pro" to activate` spawns an external AppleScript process talking back to FM, which can behave differently (slower, or not bringing the correct window to front). Always use `tell me to activate` in `Perform AppleScript` steps when the intent is to bring FileMaker itself to the foreground.

### AppleScript `activate` is required
Without `activate` in the AppleScript template, FM Pro stays in the background. System Events commands execute against whatever window is frontmost (not FM). Added to all `/trigger` AppleScript templates.

### FM blocks script execution with unsaved-scripts dialog
FileMaker will show a dialog and block `do script` if any scripts have unsaved changes in the Script Workspace. Agentic-fm Paste itself must be saved before running deployments. The `--auto-save` flag calls `Cmd+S` at the end to clean up for subsequent runs.

### `fmextscriptaccess` required
The extended privilege "Allow Apple events and ActiveX to perform FileMaker operations" must be enabled on the account's privilege set in Manage Security. Without it, `do script` returns `-10004` at runtime. No compile error.

### MBS check syntax
MBS functions return `"OK"` on success and error strings on failure. Check with `Left ( $result ; 2 ) ≠ "OK"`, not `Left ( $result ; 5 ) = "ERROR"`.

## What to do next

### Set `auto_save: true` in automation.json for project use
When confident in the deployment loop, flip `auto_save` to `true` in `automation.json` to remove the `--auto-save` flag requirement.

### Run Explode XML
Agentic-fm Paste is confirmed stable. Run `Explode XML` in FM Pro to export the solution and get the latest agentic-fm scripts into `xml_parsed/`. This is the canonical record of what's installed in the solution.

### ~~Build AGFMEvaluation script~~ ✅ Done
AGFMEvaluation installed in agentic-fm.fmp12 (also installed in Invoice Solution test file). Push Context updated to write `agent/context/snapshot.xml` with `snapshot_path` and `snapshot_timestamp` in CONTEXT.json. Confirmed working 2026-03-18. Note: script IDs differ between files — always look up by name, not ID.

### ~~fm-debug autonomous validation~~ ✅ Done (2026-03-22)
Full autonomous testing of the fm-debug skill completed. The agent deployed test scripts via Tier 3, triggered them via `/trigger`, and read debug output — all without human intervention. Key discovery: `Get(LastError)` resets the error state, requiring all error data to be captured in a single `JSONSetElement` expression. See `plans/DEBUG_FINDINGS.md` for full results. Updated files: `fm-debug` skill, `AGENTIC_DEBUG.md`, new knowledge article `error-data-capture.md`.

### `deploy.py` container detection (should fix)
`deploy.py`'s `_check_accessibility()` fails in Linux containers because it tries to run `osascript` locally. For containerised agents, `deploy.py` should detect the environment and skip the local pre-flight, relying on the companion to run AppleScript. Workaround: call companion endpoints directly (as done during the 2026-03-22 testing session).

## AGFMEvaluation + Snapshot (planned)

### Purpose
Allows the agent to validate FileMaker calculation expressions at runtime against a live hosted solution. Bridges the gap between static XML generation and confirmed-correct calculation code.

### Confirmed: `Save Records as Snapshot Link` works server-side
Tested via OData → Sandbox script. The step executes without error and writes the file to `Get(DocumentsPath)` inside the FMS container. This enables both client-side reference snapshots and server-side verification snapshots.

### Context refresh architecture

**Push Context must always run on the FM Pro client.** `Context()` captures the layout state of the active client FM session. Running it server-side via OData produces the server's isolated session context (wrong layout, wrong data). Confirmed: OData call to Push Context produced `"Dashboard"` when the client was on `"Invoices Details"`.

**Correct Tier 2/3 context refresh flow**:
1. Agent calls `POST /trigger` → `{ "fm_app_name": ..., "script": "Push Context" }` (no parameter = interactive mode)
2. Companion fires `osascript do script "Push Context"` on FM Pro client
3. FM Pro shows task-description dialog; developer confirms
4. Push Context calls `Context()` client-side, writes CONTEXT.json via FM file steps, saves snapshot.xml
5. Agent reads updated CONTEXT.json

**OData is not a valid context refresh path.** Use OData only for Explode XML (server-side, topology-correct) and AGFMEvaluation (server-side calc evaluator — intentionally server context).

### Path decisions
- **`CONTEXT.json` stays at `agent/CONTEXT.json`** — no refactor. The context subdirectory (`agent/context/`) holds index files and will also hold the reference snapshot.
- **Client reference snapshot**: `agent/context/snapshot.xml` — written by Push Context (client-side, via `/trigger` + `do script`), readable directly by the agent from the repo filesystem
- **Server verification snapshot**: `Get(DocumentsPath) & "snapshot-eval.xml"` — written by AGFMEvaluation server-side, readable by companion (same path mechanism as Explode XML)
- **`snapshot_path` field added to `CONTEXT.json`** — Push Context writes the absolute path of the reference snapshot so the agent always knows where to find it without guessing

### AGFMEvaluation script design

**Triggered via**: OData → AGFMScriptBridge → `do script "AGFMEvaluation"`

**Parameter** (JSON):
```json
{ "expression": "Sum ( LineItems::ExtendedPrice )", "layout": "Invoices Details" }
```

**Script flow**:
1. Parse parameter JSON → `$expression`, `$layout`
2. `Go to Layout [ $layout ]`
3. `Set Variable [ $errorCode ; EvaluationError ( Evaluate ( $expression ) ) ]`
4. `Set Variable [ $result ; If ( $errorCode = 0 ; Evaluate ( $expression ) ; "" ) ]`
5. `Save Records as Snapshot Link [ Get(DocumentsPath) & "snapshot-eval.xml" ]`
6. `Exit Script [ { success, error_code, result, expression } ]`

**Return** (confirmed valid — result is a real value):
```json
{ "success": true, "error_code": 0, "result": "4", "expression": "2 + 2", "layout": "Dashboard" }
```

**Return** (ambiguous — `"?"` with error_code 0):
```json
{ "success": true, "error_code": 0, "result": "?", "expression": "Sum ( LineItems::ExtendedPrice )", "layout": "Invoices Details" }
```

**Return** (parameter error — bad JSON):
```json
{ "success": false, "error": "Invalid parameter: expected JSON object" }
```

### Critical limitation: `EvaluationError` catches almost nothing

Tested and confirmed: FM returns `"?"` with `error_code: 0` for all of the following:
- Invalid `Get()` parameter name (`Get(NonExistentFunc)` → `"?"`, code 0)
- Syntax errors / unbalanced expressions (`If ( 1 = 1 ; "yes"` → `"?"`, code 0)
- Non-existent field references (`Invoices::NonExistentField999` → `"?"`, code 0)
- Division by zero (`1 / 0` → `"?"`, code 0)

FM converts most expression problems to `"?"` rather than raising a numbered error. `EvaluationError` is not a reliable syntax checker.

### Agent interpretation rules for `calc-eval`

| result | error_code | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Real value (not `"?"`) | 0 | ✅ Confirmed valid — expression ran and produced data |
| `"?"` | 0 | ⚠️ Unverifiable — expression may be invalid OR valid with no data in context |
| `"?"` | 0 on `Sum`/aggregate | ℹ️ Likely valid but no records in found set server-side — needs client context |
| Any | > 0 | ❌ FM error — check error code |
| (guard fired) | — | ❌ Bad parameter — not a JSON object |

When result is `"?"`: agent should flag it as unverifiable and note that a real-value confirmation requires the developer to have data in context (via a reference snapshot from Push Context).

### ~~Push Context update~~ ✅ Done
`Save Records as Snapshot Link` writes to `agent/context/snapshot.xml`. `snapshot_path` and `snapshot_timestamp` confirmed present in CONTEXT.json. Verified 2026-03-19.

### Agent verification (optional)
After `AGFMEvaluation` returns, the agent can ask the companion to read `snapshot-eval.xml` and confirm the layout name matches `CONTEXT.json current_layout.name`. A mismatch means context was not established correctly — developer needs to re-run Push Context.
